# Pydata Berlin 2018
I created two scripts: one (already existed at the last pydatabln in 2017) for querying the schedule and talk details, you can find [here](pydatabln2018_filter_and_overview.ipynb). Another one for pushing the data to according google calendars, look under [write2cal.ipynb](write2cal.ipynb).
